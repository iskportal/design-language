# Composition Logic

Compositional logic defines how elements combine without introducing noise, ornament, or distraction.

Design must:

- Prefer subtraction over addition.
- Prefer structure over surface.
- Prefer hierarchy over decoration.
- Prefer continuity over novelty.

All compositions must remain valid when stripped of color, typography, and imagery. Design must function in its most reduced form.
