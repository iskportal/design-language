# Semantic Geometry

Semantic geometry defines how meaning maps to space, scale, rhythm, and proportion — without reference to color, font, or decoration.

Meaning must be encoded through:

- **Position** (where something exists)
- **Scale** (how much space it occupies)
- **Distance** (how separated or related elements are)
- **Alignment** (how relationships are implied)
- **Sequence** (how attention flows)

Visual emphasis must always correspond to semantic importance. No visual dominance may exist without epistemic justification.

Geometry precedes style.
