# Semantic Geometry

Semantic geometry defines how meaning maps to space, scale, rhythm, and proportion — without reference to color, font, or decoration.

Geometry is not ornament. It is **epistemic encoding in spatial form.** Every positional decision, every scalar relationship, every interval must correspond to a semantic relationship. Visual structure must be meaning structure.

If geometry is arbitrary, meaning is obscured. If geometry is decorative, cognition is burdened.

## Positional Encoding

**Position encodes existence, priority, and relationship.** Where something exists in space determines how it is perceived, interpreted, and remembered.

### Spatial Priority

Elements positioned at the **top** or **leading edge** (left in LTR languages, right in RTL) signal primary importance. Position encodes entry point — where attention begins.

Elements positioned at the **bottom** or **trailing edge** signal conclusion, summary, or secondary reference.

Elements positioned **centrally** signal formal symmetry or balanced weight. Centered position implies no directional bias — use only when semantic neutrality is structurally justified.

**Rule:** Spatial priority must correspond to epistemic priority. If a secondary element occupies the primary position, the geometry has violated equivalence.

### Proximity and Grouping

Elements positioned **near each other** signal semantic relationship. Distance encodes belonging or separation.

**Close proximity** (small intervals) signals tight coupling — elements that must be understood together.

**Distant separation** (large intervals) signals independence — elements that can be understood in isolation.

**Rule:** Proximity must encode actual relationships. If unrelated elements are positioned closely, the geometry introduces false association. If related elements are separated, the geometry obscures structure.

### Positional Stability

Primary navigational elements, persistent context, and structural anchors must remain **positionally stable** across views and states. Users build spatial memory based on position. Arbitrary positional shifts destroy orientation.

**Rule:** If an element's position changes without user action or clear causal reason, positional encoding has failed.

## Scalar Encoding

**Scale encodes magnitude, importance, and scope.** Larger elements signal greater semantic weight. Smaller elements signal subordinate or supplementary content.

### Proportional Significance

Scale must be **proportionally consistent** across the system. If Element A is twice as semantically important as Element B, its scale should reflect this proportional relationship.

**Rule:** Scale ratios must remain consistent. If headings are 2× body text in one context, they must remain 2× body text in all contexts. Random or inconsistent scaling introduces noise.

### Scalar Boundaries

Elements must remain legible and structurally coherent across all reasonable scales. An element that becomes incomprehensible when scaled down is not properly designed.

**Rule:** Minimum viable scale must be defined for all elements. If an element loses structural integrity below a certain size, it must not be rendered at that size — it must be replaced or restructured.

### Scalar Hierarchy

**No element may be visually larger than its semantic parent.** A sub-section heading cannot be larger than its section heading. A footnote cannot dominate the paragraph it annotates.

**Rule:** Scalar hierarchy must nest properly. Child elements must be visually subordinate to their semantic parents across all scales and contexts.

## Interval Encoding

**Interval encodes relationship, distinction, and breathing room.** Space is not empty — it is active structural information.

### Relational Distance

Interval defines **semantic distance.** Related elements have small intervals. Unrelated elements have large intervals.

**Rule:** Interval must be proportional to semantic distance. Elements that share a parent (siblings in the semantic tree) should have consistent intervals. Elements from different parents (cousins) should have larger intervals.

### Rhythmic Consistency

Intervals must follow **proportional rhythm** across the system. If the standard interval between paragraphs is X, the interval between sections should be proportionally larger (e.g., 2X, 3X) — not arbitrary.

**Rule:** Intervals must scale according to a defined proportional system. Random spacing breaks structural encoding.

### Cognitive Pacing

Interval governs **cognitive rhythm** — how quickly attention moves, how much processing time is given, how density is managed.

**Dense content** (data, code, reference material) requires **tighter intervals** — reduced spacing signals compact information requiring focused attention.

**Sparse content** (narrative prose, exploratory reading) requires **looser intervals** — increased spacing signals pacing, reflection, sustained engagement.

**Rule:** Interval density must match content density. Sparse intervals around dense content create false ease. Dense intervals around sparse content create false urgency.

## Alignment Encoding

**Alignment encodes relationship through implied structure.** Elements that share alignment share conceptual belonging.

### Axial Coherence

All elements must align to a **consistent grid or baseline.** Arbitrary misalignment introduces visual noise that competes with semantic structure.

**Rule:** If two elements align, they must share a semantic relationship. If two elements do not align, they must justify their independence structurally — not aesthetically.

### Edge Relationships

**Flush-left alignment** signals sequential reading and hierarchical flow. It is the default for continuous text in LTR languages.

**Centered alignment** signals symmetry, formal announcement, or balanced neutrality. Use sparingly — centered alignment interrupts flow and should only be used when symmetry is semantically justified.

**Flush-right alignment** signals annotation, metadata, or secondary reference. It visually distinguishes supporting material from primary content.

**Justified alignment** (flush on both edges) signals formality and density. Use only when textural uniformity serves comprehension — not when it introduces awkward spacing or hyphenation.

**Rule:** Alignment must encode reading logic, not aesthetic preference.

### Grid Discipline

Alignment to a proportional grid ensures **structural predictability.** Users build spatial expectations based on alignment patterns. Violations of the grid must be epistemically justified.

**Rule:** If an element breaks the grid, it must signal exceptional importance or structural independence. Random grid breaks are noise.

---

## Sequential Encoding

**Sequence encodes narrative, causality, and cognitive flow.** The order in which elements appear determines the order in which they are processed.

### Reading Paths

Primary content follows the **natural reading direction** of the language (LTR, RTL, vertical). Secondary content and annotations may deviate from this path, but only when their semantic role justifies deviation.

**Rule:** Reading paths must be unambiguous. If the user cannot determine what to read next, the sequence has failed.

### Logical Ordering

Sequence must reflect **logical dependencies.** If understanding Element B requires understanding Element A, A must precede B in spatial or temporal sequence.

**Rule:** Sequence encodes causality. Arbitrary or aesthetically-driven reordering introduces cognitive friction.

### Attention Flow

Sequence determines **attention trajectory** — where the eye moves, where processing begins, where comprehension accumulates.

**Rule:** The most important element must be encountered first (or most prominently). Sequential order must correspond to epistemic priority.

## Operational Rules

1. **Position encodes priority.** Top, leading edge, and central positions signal importance. Placement is not arbitrary.
2. **Scale encodes magnitude.** Larger elements signal greater semantic weight. Proportions must remain consistent.
3. **Interval encodes relationship.** Distance signals belonging or separation. Spacing is proportional and rhythmic.
4. **Alignment encodes structure.** Shared alignment signals shared meaning. Grid discipline is enforced.
5. **Sequence encodes causality.** Order reflects logical dependencies and epistemic priority.

## Validity Constraints

Semantic geometry is **valid** if:

1. **Visual emphasis corresponds to semantic importance.** No decorative dominance exists.
2. **Spatial relationships encode actual relationships.** Proximity, alignment, and sequence reflect meaning.
3. **Proportions are consistent.** Scale, interval, and rhythm follow a defined system across all contexts.
4. **Structure remains legible in wireframe.** Geometry functions without color, typography, or decoration.

Semantic geometry is **invalid** if:

1. **Position is arbitrary.** Elements are placed for aesthetic balance rather than epistemic necessity.
2. **Scale is inconsistent.** Proportional relationships vary randomly across contexts.
3. **Intervals are random.** Spacing does not encode semantic distance.
4. **Alignment is decorative.** Elements align or misalign without structural justification.
5. **Sequence is aesthetically driven.** Order does not reflect logical dependencies or priority.

Geometry precedes style. Spatial relationships encode meaning before any refinement is applied. A correct geometry clarifies structure invisibly. A failed geometry introduces friction, obscures relationships, or privileges appearance over understanding.

Space is not empty. Space is information.
