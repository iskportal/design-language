# Grammar 

Structural grammar defines how visual and spatial elements are organized, composed, and related — independent of content domain, platform, or interface.

Design is constructed from a limited set of primitives:

- **Field** — the spatial context in which information exists.
- **Block** — a bounded unit of meaning.
- **Axis** — the directional logic governing flow and alignment.
- **Interval** — the controlled absence between elements.
- **Hierarchy** — the relational ordering of emphasis.

All compositions must be reducible to these primitives. No decorative or stylistic element may exist outside this grammar.

Structure must remain legible when reduced to wireframe, grayscale, or typographic skeleton. If structure collapses without styling, the design is invalid.
